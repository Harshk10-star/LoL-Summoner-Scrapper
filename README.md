# LoL-Summoner-Scrapper
An application to get a players stats in Leauge of Legends using Riot API

I order to run this you must generate an API Key as I do not have a permanent key at https://developer.riotgames.com/

To run:

1. go to file directory
2. npm install
3. node app.js -to run on port 3000
